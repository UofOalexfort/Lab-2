# Lab-2

Lab 2 focussed on working with git within the CLI. We learned how to create directories within the CLI, as well as initialize these directories as repositories. From there, we learned how to add and commit files to the repository, as well as use an .gitignore file. Lastly, we worked on cloning a cloud repository locally.
